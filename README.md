# fromSoundOfSneezeToUnderstandingBehaviours
I will put here some of codes about sneeze recognition with fuzzy logic and machine learning
There are lots of professors who think like me about sounds and their sign of what.
In this project I want to prove relationship between sound of sneeze and personel behaviours. 
My idea is based on volume of sneeze which if volume is high, it is a rude kind of person with high possibility. 
If volume is like a cat's sneeze, it is a very kind person with high possibility.
Also, there are several researches about cough and lung diseases.
